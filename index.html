        <p> A <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean">Coffee bean</a></em></strong> is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source
            for coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a coffee
            cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit.
            Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such 
            because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most
            commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of 
            cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry"
            . The peaberry occurs only between 10% and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common
            (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee
            beans.[3] Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of 
            endosperm.[4]. </p>
        <h2><li>Types of Coffee:</li></h2>
        <p><strong><li>Arabica</li></strong>
            As mentioned earlier, Arabica is the most common (and certainly most heavily 
            marketed) type of coffee in North America. That’s because it actually has a 
            sweeter, more delicate flavor and the coffee itself tends to be less acidic. 
            Arabica beans are farmed in areas with high elevations above sea level, 
            particularly those where rain is plentiful. In fact, Brazil, known for its
            lush rainforest, is the world’s foremost exporter of Arabica beans. The 
            plants themselves are fairly delicate, requiring a fair amount of pruning 
            and constant attention to environmental factors. The Coffee arabica species
            is particularly prone to disease so farming in great quantities is a challenge.
            This drives up the cost of the bean considerably in the global market, but 
            many coffee drinkers around the world are happy to pay the difference because 
            of the softer, sweeter taste.</p>
        <p><strong><li>Rebusta</li></strong>
            When it comes to global production, Robusta coffee beans are second on the 
            list and the most popular in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its name
            does this bean justice, as it is known for its strong and often harsh flavor
            profile. Robusta coffees have extremely high levels of caffeine, which makes 
            the plant far more resilient than the Arabica species. That’s because the
            caffeine acts as natural insect repellent, eliminating a major threat to 
            the tree. The coffee caniphora species is also particularly tolerant of its 
            environment, so it can be grown in any number of altitudes and climatels.
            Because of its reputation for tasting burnt or rubbery, robusta is not
            generally a very popular coffee commodity, except where very strong
            coffee is a cultural norm. However, because it’s so much easier to 
            grow and harvest than Arabica beans, many farmers do tend to reap 
            higher profits when they can sell Robusta. So where is it going? 
            Robusta might be used for discount lines like instant coffees and is 
            sometimes used as a filler in dark roasts. By using 3 parts Arabica 
            to 1 part Robusta in a given batch, a roaster might save up to 20% on 
            the cost of raw beans. However, if this looks to you like sacrificing
            product quality for the bottom line, you’d be right.</p>

            and Rebusta plus other benefits.</p>
